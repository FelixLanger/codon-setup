### Setting up SSH Access

Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol used to securely log onto remote systems. It is the most common way to access remote Linux and UNIX-like servers, such as the Codon Compute Cluster.

### Configuring Tmux

Tmux, short for terminal multiplexer, allows you to run multiple terminal sessions within a single window. It's incredibly useful for running multiple commands simultaneously or keeping sessions active even after disconnecting.
